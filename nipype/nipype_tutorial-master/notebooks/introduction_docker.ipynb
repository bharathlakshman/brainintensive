    "[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. Those containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, system tools, software libraries, such as Python, FSL, AFNI, SPM, FreeSurfer, ANTs, etc. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.\n",

For more information on how to do this see the [Installation Section](resources_installation.ipynb) of this tutorial. But for Windows user, or users that don't want to setup all the dependencies themselves, Docker is the way to go."

    "# How to run ``miykael/nipype_course``\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing docker on your system and making sure that the ``hello-world`` example was running, we are good to go to start the Nipype Course image. The exact implementation is a bit different for Windows user, but the general command looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    docker run -ti --rm -p 8888:8888 -v /home/username/results:/output miykael/nipype_course\n",
    "\n",
    "But what do those flags mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ``-ti`` flag tells docker that it should open an interactive container instance.\n",
    "- The ``--rm`` flag tells docker that the container should automatically be removed after we close docker.\n",
    "- The ``-p`` flag specifies which port we want to make available for docker.\n",
    "- The ``-v`` flag tells docker which folder (here: ``/home/username/results`` it should mount to make it accesible inside the container. The second part of the ``-v`` flag (here: ``/output``) specifies under which path the mounted folder can be found inside the container. This means that we can use the folder ``/output`` inside the tutorial to save data outside the docker container under ``/home/username/results``. **Important**: To use the ``results`` folder, you first need to create it on your system!\n",
    "- The last argument ``miykael/nipype_course`` tells docker that we want to run this docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a docker image, docker will look for the specified image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/miykael/nipype_course/). If the docker image was already download to your system, it will be directly opened. Otherwise, it first needs to download all containers, which might take some time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run a docker image on Linux or Mac\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a docker image on a Linux or Mac OS is very simple. Make sure that you've created a results folder on your system (e.g. ``mkdir -p /home/username/results``). Then just open a new terminal and use the command from above:\n",
    "\n",
    "    docker run -ti --rm -p 8888:8888 -v /home/username/results:/output miykael/nipype_course\n",

    "## Run a docker image on Windows\n",

    "<center><img src=\"../static/images/docker_terminal.png\" width=600></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the docker terminal is ready (when you see the whale), we can execute the following steps (see also figure):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need to check the IP adress of your docker machine. For this, use the command: \n",
    "\n",
    "    ``docker-machine ip``\n",
    "\n",
    "   In my case, this returned ``192.168.99.100``\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you haven't already created a new folder to store your container output into, do so. You can create the folder either in the explorer as usual or do it with the command ``mkdir -p`` in the docker console. For example like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``mkdir -p /c/Users/username/results``\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please replace ``username`` with the name of the current user on your system. **Pay attention** that the folder paths in the docker terminal are not backslash (``\\``) as we usually have in Windows. Also, ``C:\\`` needs to be specified as ``/c/``.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, we can open run the container with the command from above:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``docker run -ti --rm -p 8888:8888 -v /c/Users/username/outputs:/output miykael/nipype_course``\n",

    "    \n",
    "    This URL will not work on a Windows system. To make it work, you need to replace the string ``localhost`` with the IP address of your docker machine, that we acquired under step 1. Afterwards, your URL should look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``http://192.168.99.100:8888/?token=0312c1ef3b61d7a44ff5346d3d150c23249a548850e13868``\n",

    "\n",
    "You don't have to open a jupyter notebook when you run ``miykael/nipype_course``. You can also access the docker container directly with ``bash`` or ``ipython`` by adding it to the end of your command, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    docker run -ti --rm -v /home/username/results:/output miykael/nipype_course bash\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Export and Import a docker image\n",
    "\n",

    "    docker load --input nipype_course.tar\n",
    "    \n",
    "It might be possible that you run into administrator privileges isssues because you ran your docker command with ``sudo``. This means that Ã²ther users don't have access rights to ``nipype_course.tar``. To avoid this, just change the rights of ``nipype_course.tar`` with the command:\n",
