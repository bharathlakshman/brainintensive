How IPython and Jupyter Notebook work

Abstract
--------
This section focuses on IPython and Jupyter notebook and how they interact.
When we discuss ``IPython``, we talk about two fundamental roles:

- Terminal IPython as the familiar REPL
- The IPython kernel that provides computation and communication with the
  frontend interfaces, like the notebook

Jupyter Notebook and its flexible interface extends the notebook beyond code
to visualization, multimedia, collaboration, and more.

Terminal IPython
----------------

When you type ``ipython``, you get the original IPython interface, running in
the terminal. It does something like this::

    while True:
        code = input(">>> ")
        exec(code)

Of course, it's much more complex, because it has to deal with multi-line
code, tab completion using :mod:`readline`, magic commands, and so on. But the
model is like code example: prompt the user for some code, and when they've
entered it, execute it in the same process. This model is often called a
:term:`REPL`, or Read-Eval-Print-Loop.

The IPython Kernel
------------------

All the other interfaces —- the Notebook, the Qt console, ``ipython console``
in the terminal, and third party interfaces —- use the IPython Kernel. The
IPython Kernel is a separate process which is responsible for running user
code, and things like computing possible completions. Frontends, like the
notebook or the Qt console, communicate with the IPython Kernel using JSON
messages sent over `ZeroMQ <http://zeromq.org/>`_ sockets; the protocol used
between the frontends and the IPython Kernel is described in
:ref:`jupyterclient:messaging`.

The core execution machinery for the kernel is shared with terminal IPython:

A kernel process can be connected to more than one frontend simultaneously. In
this case, the different frontends will have access to the same variables.

.. TODO: Diagram illustrating this?

This design was intended to allow easy development of different frontends
based on the same kernel, but it also made it possible to support new
languages in the same frontends, by developing kernels in those languages, and
we are refining IPython to make that more practical.

Today, there are two ways to develop a kernel for another language. Wrapper
kernels reuse the communications machinery from IPython, and implement only
the core execution part. Native kernels implement execution and communications
in the target language:

Wrapper kernels are easier to write quickly for languages that have good
Python wrappers, like `octave_kernel <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/octave_kernel>`_,
or languages where it's impractical to implement the communications machinery,
like `bash_kernel <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bash_kernel>`_. Native kernels
are likely to be better maintained by the community using them, like
`IJulia <https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl>`_ or
`IHaskell <https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell>`_.

Notebooks
---------

The Notebook frontend does something extra. In addition to running your code,
it stores code and output, together with markdown notes, in an editable
document called a notebook. When you save it, this is sent from your browser
to the notebook server, which saves it on disk as a JSON file with a
``.ipynb`` extension.

The notebook server, not the kernel, is responsible for saving and loading
notebooks, so you can edit notebooks even if you don't have the kernel for
that language—you just won't be able to run code. The kernel doesn't know
anything about the notebook document: it just gets sent cells of code to
execute when the user runs them.

Exporting notebooks to other formats
------------------------------------

The Nbconvert tool in Jupyter converts notebook files to other formats, such
as HTML, LaTeX, or reStructuredText. This conversion goes through a series of
steps:

.. image:: figs/nbconvert.png

1. Preprocessors modify the notebook in memory. E.g. ExecutePreprocessor runs
   the code in the notebook and updates the output.
2. An exporter converts the notebook to another file format. Most of the
   exporters use templates for this.
3. Postprocessors work on the file produced by exporting.

The `nbviewer <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>`_ website uses nbconvert with the
HTML exporter. When you give it a URL, it fetches the notebook from that URL,
converts it to HTML, and serves that HTML to you.

IPython.parallel
----------------

IPython also includes a parallel computing framework,
`IPython.parallel <https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. This
allows you to control many individual engines, which are an extended version
of the IPython kernel described above.
