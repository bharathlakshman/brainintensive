# Custom mimetypes (MIME types)


## What's a mimetype?

When an internet request and response occurs, a `Content-Type` header is
passed. A mimetype, also referred to as MIME type, identifies how the content
that is being returned should be handled or used, based on type, by the
application and browser. A MIME type is made up of a MIME *group* (i.e.
application, image, audio, etc.) and a MIME *subtype*. For example, a MIME
type is `image/png` where MIME *group* is `image` and *subtype* is `png`.

As types may contain vendor specific items, a
[custom vendor specific MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type#Vendor_tree),
`vnd`, can be used. A vendor specific MIME type will contain `vnd` such as
`application/vnd.jupyter.cells`.


## Custom mimetypes used in Jupyter and IPython projects

- `application/vnd.jupyter`
- `application/vnd.jupyter.cells`
- `application/vnd.jupyter.dragindex` used by nbdime
- `application/x-ipynb+json` for notebooks
