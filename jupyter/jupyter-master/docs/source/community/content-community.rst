Community Guides
================


Welcome to the Community Guides for Jupyter. These guides are intended to
provide information about the Jupyter community such as background, events,
and communication channels. As our community is highly dynamic, information
may change, and we will do our best to keep it up to date.

Weekly Dev meeting
------------------

The core developers have weekly meetings to discuss and demo what they have
been working on, discuss future plans, and bootstrap conversation. These
meetings are public. The direct link to attend the meeting will be posted to
the `Hackpad <https://jupyter.hackpad.com>`_ before the meeting. Afterwards,
the recording of the meeting will be posted to the `IPython channel
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUuzz1eYiKIzu_Uw1ZQLNoQ>`_ on YouTube.

**Jupyter/IPython meetings:**

- Tuesdays at 9am PST

**JupyterLab meetings:**

- Fridays at 9am PST

Collaborative notes are taken before/during the meeting on
`Hackpad <https://jupyter.hackpad.com>`_. Hackpads are organized by month.

We will ping the `dev-meeting-attendance Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/jupyter/dev-meeting-attendance>`_ 
1-2 days before each meeting to know who is likely going to attend.
